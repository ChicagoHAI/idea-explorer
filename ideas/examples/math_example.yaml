  title: "Tight Bounds on the Rainbow Connection Number of Random Regular Graphs"

  domain: mathematics

  hypothesis: |
    For a random d-regular graph G on n vertices with d >= 3, the rainbow
    connection number rc(G) satisfies rc(G) = ceil(n/d) + O(1) with high
    probability as n -> infinity. Specifically, we conjecture that the additive
    constant is at most 2 for d >= 5, tightening the known O(log n / d) gap
    between the current best upper and lower bounds.

  background:
    description: |
      The rainbow connection number rc(G) of a connected graph G is the minimum
      number of colors needed to color the edges so that every pair of vertices
      is connected by a path with all edges of distinct colors.

      For random regular graphs, the diameter provides a trivial lower bound:
      rc(G) >= diam(G). The current best results show diam(G) = ceil(log(n) / log(d-1))
      for random d-regular graphs, and the best upper bound on rc(G) is
      O(n/d * log(n)). There is a significant gap between these bounds that
      we aim to close.

      This research combines probabilistic combinatorics with constructive
      coloring arguments to achieve tight bounds.

    notes: |
      This is a proof-oriented research project. The primary output is
      mathematical theorems with complete proofs, supported by computational
      verification. No GPU or large datasets needed.

      The mathematics domain activates specialized agent templates that
      replace experiment-oriented workflows with proof-oriented ones:
      - Resource finder searches for prior theorems and proof techniques
      - Session instructions guide proof construction and verification
      - Paper writer uses amsart document class with theorem environments
