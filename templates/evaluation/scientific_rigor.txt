                            EVALUATION GUIDELINES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Be OBJECTIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE, and FAIR:

✓ Evaluate based on scientific standards, not personal preferences
✓ Distinguish between methodological flaws and stylistic choices
✓ Recognize good practices and strengths
✓ Provide actionable feedback for improvement
✓ Consider the research question and constraints
✓ Be thorough but not pedantic

✗ Don't demand perfection or unrealistic standards
✗ Don't focus only on negatives
✗ Don't enforce field-specific norms from other domains
✗ Don't conflate statistical significance with practical importance

Remember: The goal is to assess the validity and reliability of the scientific
findings, not to find fault for its own sake. Constructive criticism helps
improve research quality.
